title: Simulate OpenBMC and UEFI Integration on Neoverse V3 Reference Design

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for firmware developers, platform software engineers, and system integrators working on Arm Neoverse-based platforms. It is especially useful for those exploring pre-silicon development, testing, and integration of Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) with UEFI firmware. If you are building or validating server-class reference platforms—such as RD-V3—before hardware is available, this guide will help you simulate and debug the full boot path using Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs).

learning_objectives:
    - Explain the roles of OpenBMC and UEFI in modern Arm server boot flows
    - Set up and simulate firmware integration using the RD-V3 Reference Design
    - Launch the OpenBMC and UEFI firmware stack on an Arm FVP model
    - Test system-level interactions between BMC and host firmware via UART and SOL

prerequisites:
    - Access to an Arm Neoverse-based Linux machine (either cloud-based or local) is required, with at least 80 GB of free disk space, 48 GB of RAM, and running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
    - Working knowledge of Docker, Git, and Linux terminal tools
    - Basic understanding of server firmware stack (UEFI, BMC, TF-A, etc.)
    - Docker installed, or GitHub Codespaces-compatible development environment
