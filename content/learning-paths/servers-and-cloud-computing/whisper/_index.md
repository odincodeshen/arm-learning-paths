title: Run OpenAI Whisper Audio Model efficiently on Arm with Hugging Face Transformers

minutes_to_complete: 15

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers, ML engineers, and those looking to run Whisper ASR Model on Arm Neoverse based CPUs efficiently and build speech transcription based applications around it.

learning_objectives:
    - Install the dependencies to run the Whisper Model
    - Run the OpenAI Whisper model using Hugging Face Transformers framework.
    - Run the whisper-large-v3-turbo model on Arm CPU efficiently.
    - Perform the audio to text transcription with Whisper.
    - Observe the total time taken to generate transcript with Whisper.


prerequisites:
    - Amazon Graviton4 (or other Arm) compute instance with 32 cores, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB disk space.
    - Basic understanding of Python and ML concepts.
    - Understanding of Whisper ASR Model fundamentals.
